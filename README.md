# mousegame
C# dot frenzy game: To play, download and extract the zip file, open the "Publish exe" folder and run setup.exe, install, close the game, and run it again (some visual issues exist on the first run immediately after installation).

This game was created in C# using the MonoGame framework. Red dots spawn infinitely and charge at you while you try to dodge them and pick up powerups that let you destroy them for points.
